Hey, lets deploy a web application, a simple html doc, that will be hosted in EKS and exposed to the outside world.
Use github as source control, github actions as CI/CD, Terraform as IAC, AWS as cloud provider.
EKS as K8S cluster, use nginx ingress to map traffic from route 53 to EKS.
make sure you are working with VSCODE, and can connect to the EKS within VSCODE.
As a final stage, create a simple monitoring dashboard to track infra metrics and cloudwatch to view application logs.

Sure, let's break down the steps:

Create a Simple HTML Document: Start by creating a simple HTML document for your web application.

Set Up GitHub Repository: Create a new repository on GitHub to host your code.

Configure GitHub Actions: Set up GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Define workflows to build and deploy your application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.

Infrastructure as Code with Terraform: Write Terraform scripts to provision the necessary infrastructure on AWS, including the EKS cluster, Route 53 configuration, and any other resources needed.

Deploy EKS Cluster: Use Terraform to deploy the EKS cluster with the necessary configurations.

Configure Nginx Ingress: Set up Nginx Ingress controller on the EKS cluster to route traffic from Route 53 to your services.

Connect Visual Studio Code to EKS: Install the necessary extensions in Visual Studio Code to connect to the EKS cluster using tools like the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio Code.

Monitoring Dashboard: Create a monitoring dashboard using tools like Grafana or AWS CloudWatch to track infrastructure metrics. Set up CloudWatch to monitor application logs.

Deploy Web Application: Use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy your web application to the EKS cluster whenever changes are made to the repository.

Test and Verify: Test the deployment to ensure everything is working as expected. Verify that the web application is accessible and that monitoring is set up correctly.

Documentation: Document the setup and deployment process for future reference.
